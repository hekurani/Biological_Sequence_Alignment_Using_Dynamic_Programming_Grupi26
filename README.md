# DNA Sequence Alignment using Dynamic Programming

This project implements DNA sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm combined with the affine gap penalty model. The solution is designed for accurate alignment of two DNA sequences, taking into account the biological significance of gaps and mismatches.

## Features

- Implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
- Supports affine gap penalties for biologically meaningful alignments.
- Efficiently aligns DNA sequences using dynamic programming.
- Includes an intuitive user interface for input and visualization of results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:
- A Windows-based system.
- Microsoft Visual Studio (recommended version: 2010 or higher).
- Basic knowledge of DNA sequence alignment algorithms.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hekurani/Biological_Sequence_Alignment_Using_Dynamic_Programming_Grupi26.git
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
### Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Input two DNA sequences to align.
3. Adjust scoring parameters (match, mismatch, gap opening, and gap extension penalties) as needed.
4. Run the alignment to view the results.
### Algorithm Overview
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a global alignment algorithm that uses dynamic programming to compute an optimal alignment between two sequences. The affine gap model introduces a penalty for opening a gap and a smaller penalty for extending the gap, better reflecting biological processes.
